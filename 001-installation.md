## Installation

Installation of Freeschema Frontend.



Freeschema is a multi layered system but can be developed with a single package called Freeschema Frontend. This is available in github as https://github.com/Mentor-Friends/Freeschema-Frontend.

The Freeschema has different layers like permanent store, data layer, distribution layer then frontend layer.

This Frontend layer is designed so that we can create an Single page application using our knowledge of javascript. With just javascript and the knowledge of freeschema we can create a complex website. That is the strength of freeschema.



To start using freeschema

```
git clone https://github.com/Mentor-Friends/Freeschema-Frontend 

// then afterwards install all the packages using npm install
npm install 

// now you can run freeschema
npm run dev
```



Currently this framework is not installed by any script and installed by git. Since any person developing in this framework will not have access to the main Freeschema-Frontend git repository. You need to delete the .git folder inside of this project and create your own git repository.

To do this just go to the folder inside Freeschema-Frontend and delete the .git folder present there.

You can initialize your own repository after that.


To change the origin, In environment.dev.ts change the https://theta.boomconcole.com to https://boomconsole.com .This will change your origin server. If you do not change it you will have to signup again (if you have your humanizing data / boomconsole login).
